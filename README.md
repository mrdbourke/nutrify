# Nutrify - take a photo of food and learn about it


## How to run locally

To run this locally, it is as simple as

```
pipenv run streamlit run foot_image_collector.py
```
TODO: Can make this into a shell script
TODO: have a main.py

Work in progress.

To make this a thing, we're going to need lots of food images...

Start uploading your food images here: https://share.streamlit.io/mrdbourke/nutrify/main/food_image_collector.py

Streaming progress on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mrdbourke)/making videos about it on YouTube.

**End goal:** take a photo of food an learn about it (nutrition information, where it's from, recipes, etc).

Something like this (a data flywheel for food images):

**Status:** making a small application to collect large amounts of food images.
