# Nutrify - take a photo of food and learn about it

Work in progress.

To make this a thing, we're going to need lots of food images...

Start uploading your food images here: https://share.streamlit.io/mrdbourke/nutrify/main/food_image_collector.py 

Streaming progress on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mrdbourke)/making videos about it on YouTube.

**End goal:** take a photo of food an learn about it (nutrition information, where it's from, recipes, etc).

Something like this (a data flywheel for food images):

**Status:** making a small application to collect large amounts of food images.
